# b2bPlatform

A robust **Task Management Backend** built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of my Node.js and TypeScript learning journey. It demonstrates best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and type-safe backend systems for task management scenarios.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for static type-checking and better developer experience.
- **Express.js** (presumed): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Other dependencies**: See [`package.json`](./package.json) for full list.
